# Occupied
Occupied is a web-based platform to help facilitate and control space reservation in a given structure.

It represents the structures (e.g. buildings, halls) as **Blueprints** and spaces within those structures (e.g. classrooms, meeting rooms) as **Spaces**.

## Installation

To start hosting your own local setup, you'll need the following prerequisites
* Node.JS + NPM
* PostgreSQL

After gathering all the dependencies,

* Clone this repository
* Run,
```bash
cd Occupied
node app.js #This will start the backend
```
* Open a new terminal and run,
```bash
cd client
npm start #This will start the frontend
```
Currently, the build has been tested to work on `Ubuntu >= 18.04`.
